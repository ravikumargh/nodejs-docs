# Introduction to Node.js
Node.js is a powerful JavaScript runtime environment, built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine. Node.js is open-source and cross platform.

## What is Node.js?
Node.js is not a programming language like Python, Java or C/C++. Node.js is a runtime, similar to Java virtual machine, that converts JavaScript code into machine code. 
Unlike client-side JavaScript, which runs in the browser, Node.js is designed to run on a server. With Node.js, it is possible to use JavaScript as a backend.

### Key Features of Node.js
* Asynchronous and Event-Driven: Node.js operates on a non-blocking I/O model. This means that while performing tasks like reading a file, making a network request, or querying a database, Node.js doesn't wait for the response before moving on to the next task. It uses events and callbacks to handle responses when they are ready.

* Single-Threaded with Event Loop: Although Node.js is single-threaded, meaning it runs on a single thread of execution, it uses an event loop to handle multiple operations simultaneously. This makes it highly efficient for I/O-heavy tasks, like web servers, without creating multiple threads for each connection.

* Lightweight and Fast: Node.js is known for its performance and speed. This is largely because it uses the V8 engine and its non-blocking architecture. Tasks are processed concurrently, which makes Node.js scalable and fast.

* Cross-Platform: Node.js can run on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it highly versatile for developing applications that need to work on different platforms.

## Node.js Architecture (Single-Threaded Event Loop) 
The Node.js architecture revolves around a single-threaded event loop. This is different from traditional multi-threaded server models like Apache, which handle each request in a separate thread. Instead, Node.js handles all requests in a single thread but uses asynchronous, non-blocking I/O operations to perform tasks in the background.

### How the Event Loop Works:
* When a request comes in, Node.js pushes the request to the event loop.
* If the request is non-blocking (like reading a file or database query), Node.js assigns the task to the worker pool and continues handling other requests.
* Once the task is completed, the event loop receives the result and executes the callback function associated with the task.
* This allows Node.js to handle thousands of requests concurrently without the need for multiple threads.
