# Node.js Environment Setup
This Node.js tutorial consists of a number of ready-to-run examples, so that the learn can understand the Node.js concepts by running the code. To be able to execute the example code, you can use our online Node.js environment, or install Node.js environment in your local machine.

# Local Environment Setup
If you are still willing to set up your environment for Node.js, this section will guide you. Node.js can be installed on different OS platforms such as Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, etc. You need the following tools on your computer âˆ’
* The Node.js binary installer
* Node Package Manager (NPM)
* IDE or Text Editor

Binaries for various OS platforms are available on the downloads page of the official website of Node.js. Visit https://nodejs.org/en/downloadto get the list.
The installation takes you through a few steps of the installation wizard. It also adds the installation directory of Node.js executable to the system path.

To verify if Node.js has been successfully installed, open the command prompt and type node -v. If Node.js is installed successfully then it will display the version of the Node.js installed on your machine, as shown below.
```
node -v
```
NPM (Node Package Manager) is included in Node.js binaries from its official website since Node version 0.6.0., so you are not required to install it separately.
